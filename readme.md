# The Bowdoin Orient
## B.O.N.U.S. 2.0

The Orient website has been online since sometime in the late 1990s, with earliest extant content dating back to September 2000. It previously underwent major revisions in 2001, 2004, and 2009. In 2004, it switched from static HTML to a PHP/MySQL web app. The 2009 revision was purely cosmetic; now, for the first time in 8 years, it is being rewritten from scratch.
